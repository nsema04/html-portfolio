<h1>About Me, Noah Semashkewich</h1>
<p>I am an aspiring web developer studying computer science at the University of British Columbia. I am currently
  learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, and many more different tools that I will use when I enter the workfield. I am
  incredibly passionate about the field of computer science, and I believe there are many amazing things that I can
  contribute to the world of technology. I am excited to complete my degree and use my skills towards something I love.</p>

<p>I started coding in my first year of university, and have learned an immense amount of things in the last two years.
  I have spent countless hours trying to write assembly code, memorize sorting algorithms, and debug my code. Although these
  all may seem like tedious things, I can admit that I have found joy in the learning process of computer science. I have learned
  that failure is an essential part of success and without putting in effort just to fail, no progress would ever be made.
  I am overjoyed that I will be able to be a part of this exciting field!</p>

<p>Some relevent University class that I have completed include:
  <ul>
    <li>COSC 111 - Computer Programming I</li>
    <li>COSC 121 - Computer Programming II</li>
